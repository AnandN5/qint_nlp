Non Conformance 2004-029_4 is found during Audit 2004-029;
Non-Compliance with the protocol – non-compliance with ICH-GCP 4.5.1, 21 CFR 312.60.
There was no documentation to verify that Subject S1013 had received “prescribed prior treatment for a previous episode of depression” as required according to inclusion criteria #7.  The PI documented that the patient received supportive therapy from the General Practitioner; however, medical records obtained from the General Practitioner for that time period did not support the claim of supportive therapy. 

The Ongoing Site Visit report for the visit conducted on 04-05-Apr-2012 noted the lack of documentation for the supportive therapy; however, per the report the Lundbeck Medical Expert agreed that Dr. Philips documenting that the General Practitioner provided supportive therapy for the patient was “sufficient” documentation. On 09-May-2012, the PI faxed a letter to the General Practitioner indicating that the patient had verbally stated that he had received supportive therapy for depression in Aug 2010 and was out of work for 6 weeks due to his depression and if this “information is reasonably accurate” to please sign the note and fax back to Dr. Philips office; however, at the time of this audit the General Practitioner had not responded..

The medical records pertaining to the previous episode of MDE and supportive therapy should have been collected by the PI prior to the randomization of the subject. In addition there was not adequate follow-up by the PI to get the supporting documentation from the General Practitioner.
Non Conformance 2004-029_4 is reported on 23/05/2012;

Falsification of records by the Investigator – non-compliance with ICH-GCP 4.9.1, 21 CFR 312.62, CPSO Policy #5-05.

For patient S1012 the disability insurance claim forms dated 06 Feb 2012 and 05 Apr 2012, respectively, contained different information compared to the entries in the medical records and eCRF. The entries were as follows:
- Insurance form dated 06-Feb-2012 - prescribed treatment as “medication and support therapy”
- Insurance form dated 05-Apr-2012 - prescribed treatment as “antidepressant therapy and support therapy, Cipralex to be discontinued, pt is to start Cymbalta 60mg PO QD by next visit”
- Medical records and eCRF - concomitant medication Cipralex and the support therapy not documented

The PI confirmed during an interview that the medication and therapy recorded on the insurance forms had not been prescribed and he had only recorded this information on the insurance forms so the patient would not lose their insurance benefits.  The prescribed treatments documented on the insurance forms were exclusionary making the subject ineligible for study participation and contradicted what was documented in the medical records. 

This issue was noted by the CRA since 05-Mar-2012; however, the CRA did not notify ICON and/or Lundbeck management and did not document the issue in a monitoring report. (see observation #10).
Non Conformance 2004-029_6 reported date is 23/05/2012;
its closed date is 31/08/2012;

Incomplete and inaccurate medical records / documentation  – non-compliance with ICH-GCP 4.9.1, 21 CFR 312.62, CPSO Policy #5-05.

The site was not provided with instructions as to the information that should be included in the medical records for the study. 

Source documentation consisted of dictated clinical trial notes, source document worksheets, laboratory reports, and ECGs printouts.  Dr. Philip’s also maintained medical progress notes on his patient’s which were unlike his dictated clinical trials notes which were vague and did not provide adequate information, for example:
• It was not always documented  that patients were participating in a clinical trial, ie: for patient S1012, there was no documentation in the medical records of participation in a clinical trial
• For patients S1007, S1012, S1013, S1032 it was documented in the medical records that they were to “continue current treatment”; however, the current treatment was not defined in any of the medical progress notes and was not always consistent with what was documented on other source documents  
• There were discrepancies noted in the source documents:
•  Onset of the episodes of depression / duration for subject S1013
•  Start and stop dates of medications were not always recorded for subjects S1007, S1012, S1013
•  Subject S1007 letter dated 11-Jan-12 patient does not smoke vs. letter dated 08-Feb-2010, source document worksheets and the eCRF             which documented that the patient smoked.

The monitor confirmed that she had reviewed the information on the insurance forms for Subject S1012 and had questioned the PI as the treatments documented on the insurance forms were exclusionary for the study. After questioning the PI, she was aware that the information was erroneous; however, there was no documentation that she reported the issue to Lundbeck or escalated the issue to ICON management. In addition, the information was not documented in the OSV reports dated 05-Mar-2012 or 04-Apr-2012. The latest monitoring visit was conducted on 02-03-May-2012 by the CRA and Lead CRA; however, this report was not available in the sponsor TMF and it was not known if this information was reported in this OSV report.

Non Conformances:

Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_1 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Lack of adherence with the protocol (ICH-GCP 4.5.1)

The blood analysis results for subject S1798 were received on 05-Nov-2008, one day after the subject was randomised on 04-Nov-2008 and as per the source document, these were only reviewed on 08-Nov-2008. As per the interview the PI always received the results timely from the central lab, if needed over the telephone; however this was not documented.
For the non conformance 2005-011_1, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 9/08/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_2 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Inadequate informed consent procedures (ICH-GCP 4.8)
 
a) There were two copies of the pharmacogenetics consent present on file for subject S1080; both were signed by the PI but not by the patient, which suggests that the investigator would sign before the subject. This is not considered appropriate as per ICH-GCP and was already pointed in a previous audit.
b) There was no full name present on the consent for subject S1378 as required
c) S1575: the ICF stated that an original ICF was handed out to the subject on 16-Oct-2008, while the subject was consented on 01-Oct-2008. Further the ICF was not signed but double-dated by the PI.
d) Two copies of the SIS/ICF version 02 were found for subjects S1264 and S1378. The reason was unclear.

For the non conformance 2005-011_2, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 9/08/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_3 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Lack of recording data in the eCRF (ICH-GCP 4.9.1).
I - Subject S1798:
a) As per the eCRF the patient took no concomitant medication at all; however the
medical records mentioned that the subject took SERETIDE 50/500 bid and
VENTOLINE prn, and that she was taking STILNOX in the evenings. This is
mentioned in a letter from another physician dated 22-0ct-2008, while the
subject was screened 31-0ct-2008 and enrolled 04-Nov-2008.
b) The subject's medical condition at screening as per the medical records included
irritable bowel and pseudomembranic colitis, which were not recorded as part of
medical history
c) After Subject S1798 experienced worsening of depression (SAE occurred on 06-
Nov-2008), she went to consult a cardiologist as she had a feeling of quick heart
frequency; however this was not recorded as an AE in the eCRF, as well as the
concomitant drug (Lanoxin) given when the condition (ATRIAL TACHYCARDIA)
was confirmed by the cardiologist.
II - Subject S1246
d) As per his records the subject took Nestrolan and Alprazolan due to stress
(disallowed medication; however intake dates unclear), which were noted in a
Letter to patient's GP in 14 May 2008. It was unclear if the patient really took
these medications, as these were not reported in the eCRF. In the same way the
stress was not reported in the eCRF
e) Further, sleep disorders and then irritability were noted in the subject medical
records; however not in the eCRF.

For the non conformance 2005-011_3, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 6/08/2012;
the rating is Major;
And the non Conformance type is Data breach.
									
Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_4 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Lack of supportive information in the patient medical records (ICH-GCP 4.9.2).

A- Lack of source or supportive documentation for reported serious adverse events:
For two of the patients reviewed S1102 and S1798, there was an overall lack of
information in the subject medical records regarding the SAEs experienced and course
of the events as well as treatments; eg:
1. For S1102 having experienced 'Hospitalisation due to acute abdominal pain', the
only documentation in the source was at visit 5 regarding a telephone visit,
because the subject was admitted in another hospital for pains in stomach and
received IV antibiotics. There was no hospitalisation report and it was therefore
not possible to reconcile the information present in the eCRF and CIOMS form
versus a source document.
2. For S1798 experiencing 'Worsening of depression', there was neither element in
the medical records to indicate that the subject experienced a SAE as such. A
short hospitalisation report was however present, which stated that the reason
for admission was a psychiatric decompensation, and the subject stayed at
hospital for some days to get support. It was not clear from this report or other
source documents what the course of the event was, whether the subject took
any medication or had to undertake psychotherapy during the hospitalisation
period.
B - Discrepancies between eCRF, or reported data and the source documents
3. Subject S1246: Paracetamol taken from OS - 10 Jun 2008 was noted in the
eCRF; however not noted in the subject medical records
4. As per medical records subject S1102 experienced panic attack in Jun-2007; this
was not reported and it is unclear if this should have been noted in the eCRF as
a relevant medical history.
5. Subject S1102 took CONTRAMAL (derivative of TRAMADOL) from 04-Apr to 10-
May-2008; however there was no AE/justification/indication for starting intake of
CONTRAMAL at this date in the medical records and the eCRF indicated 'pains'
without specifying which kind of pains. This was an excluded concomitant medication (use of analgesics disallowed during the study as per appendix II)
and was reported in listing 2 of the C5R. Additionally, the CONTRAMAL drug was
not reported on the 5AE CIOM5 form as a concomitant medication, while it was
started 1 month before the 5AE 'acute abdominal pain' and continued during the
event (the field 'concomitant drug and dates ... ' in the CIOM5 was left with a
comment 'CM not available'.
C - General deficiencies in the source documentation
6. It could be seen from the subject medical notes that they were followed in the
clinic for several years; however all eligibility criteria were not always described,
eg: for 51102 or 51246 who lacked documentation of their previous episodes
reported in the eCRF.
7. There were generally no progress notes in the source documents and
additionally start and stop dates for AEs or concomitant medication could not
always be verified in the source. This prevented among others verification that
some of the eligibility criteria (eg: required wash-out) were fulfilled.
8. Further IMP compliance or/and changes in dosage were lacking documentation in
the subject notes.
Action to A-B-C; No Corrective action
However the PI was advised to look if further source documentation for the
5AE experienced by subjects 51102 and 51798 was present in the clinic
archives, as supportive documentation for the 5AE cases. If more
documentation is found or if discrepancies are confirmed, the 5AE
cases/CIOM5 may be updated.

For the non conformance 2005-011_4, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 6/08/2012;
the rating is Major;
And the non Conformance type is Data breach.

Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_5 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Inadequate supply of the IMP (ICH-GCP 5.14.1).
a) As per one of the memo from Lundbeck Clinical Trial Supply informing of
continuation double blinded treatment, the patient randomised to R3492 needed
to receive the two following IP numbers: R5065 and R5067; however there were
neither received IMP package nor patient allocated with this R number 3492 at
this site. There was no follow-up documentation regarding this and it is unclear,
if the mistake had any consequence, eg: if the two allocated IMP packs missed
at another site.
b) On one of the IMP packs (Order 096/P1286) sent 15-Jul-2008 and received by
the site on 18-Jul-2008, the site staff/CRA commented t hat the package for
subject no A1615, which was due to be in the delivered package, was not
included in the box. There was no follow-up documentation and it is unclear if the
pack could be retrieved and how this was further followed-up.

For the non conformance 2005-011_5, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 9/08/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Event and incident.

Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_6 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Discrepancies in the site study essential documents (ICH-GCP 8.4.3).
The following discrepancies were noted on the Patient identification and enrolment log:
a) Randomisation numbers for 6 of the randomised patients were lacking: 51399,
51431, 51486, 51571, 51575 and 51798.
b) Additionally the following mistakes/lacked were noticed on the id log :
• Patient 51127 hold R3131 as Randomisation number on id log instead of R3231
• Patient 51575 had Female as gender instead of Male
• For subject 51264 there was no internal dossier number on the log stated as
('not present'), although the file for this patient could be retrieved in the hospital
Action: The Patient identification and enrolment log should be corrected/completed
with the lacking information.

For the non conformance 2005-011_6, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 9/08/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Data breach.
											
Non Conformance ID is 2005-011_7 is found during Audit 2005-011;
Lack of essential documents in the sponsor TMF (ICH-GCP 8.4).
As the study essential documents were reconciled from H. Lundbeck Central Archives
(RCA), it was noticed that only 3 of the 4 SAEs reported for this site, could be retrieved
in the sponsor TMF. The SAE for subject 51102 (DKLU1032295- hospitalisation due to
acute abdominal pain) was not present as well as the correspondence regarding this
case.
A copy of the full set of documentation regarding this SAE case was taken from the site
Investigator-TM F.
For the non conformance 2005-011_7, the reported date is 9/06/2012;
the closed date is 9/08/2012;

These boxes could not be found on stock. - A52825 was found on stock but was not listed on the form." Non Conformance 2007-011_1 reported date is 6/12/2012; Non Conformance closed date is 22/08/2012; Non Conformance rating is Minor; Non Conformance type is Other.                                                                                                                                                                                  Non Conformance 2007-011_2 is found during Audit 2007-011; Lack of documentation about increase in dose (ICH-GCP 4.9.2).
According to the protocol the HLu AA21004 dose can be increased to 20 mg/day at the end of weeks 1, 2, 3, and 4. The dose of agomelatine can be increased to 50 mg/day at the end of weeks 2, 3, and 4. When reviewing subject S1149 it was observed that the dose on the IWRS email on 02-May-2012 (visit 3) was stated as “high”. When asked about this the investigators answered that this was the documentation for increasing the dose in IWRS. This was however the only documentation on file for the dose increase – it was not commented upon in the notes in the medical record. The same was observed for the other randomised subjects when briefly comparing the notes for visit 3 with the IWRS documentation."         Non Conformance 2007-011_2 reported date is 6/12/2012; Non Conformance closed date is 22/08/2012; Non Conformance rating is Minor; Non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.  Non Conformance 2007-011_3 is found during Audit 2007-011; No subject identifier on each page in the medical record. (ICH-GCP 4.9.1).
 The medical records consist of either handwritten notes or typed notes, printed by the investigator. Normally each visit is summarised on one paper with a subject identifier at the top of the page, but for certain visits, eg: the screening visit, more than one page is used to summarise the status of the subject. Then only the first page carries a subject identifier.

Ambiguous questions in the eCRF (ICH-GCP 2.10). There are two questions in the eCRF regarding the previous anti-depression therapy the subjects had received. One is ""Did the patient respond to t reatment"" and the other is ""Did the patient tolerate the treatment"". When reviewing 51149 it was observed that the investigators had answered ""Yes"" to the first question and ""No"" to the second. The explanation was that t he investigators had seen partial response. ""Tolerate"" was interpreted as ""developing tolerance"" and hence answered with no. No adverse events from previous antidepressant t herapy were documented in the medical record. This issue had been ra ised by the CRA and the ICON PM to DM since investigators also in Lithuania and Estonia had made the same interpretation." Non Conformance 2007-011_5 reported date is 6/12/2012; Non Conformance closed date is 22/08/2012; Non Conformance rating is Major; Non Conformance type is Event and incident.   Non Conformance 2007-011_6 is found during Audit 2007-011;
Limited number of un-blinding codes. (ICH-GCP 5.13.1).
 Breaking the blind in emergency situations is done through the IWRS system and requires a specific code. At this site only the PI had been provided with such a code. The same was noted in another site audit in March 2012 (Audit No: 2003-018) and the PM responded in late May 2012 that “Clarification sent to all CRAs to request unblinding access to second person on site”. According to the documentation at site, this had not yet been done for this site." Non Conformance 2007-011_6 reported date is 6/12/2012; Non Conformance closed date is 22/08/2012; Non Conformance rating is Minor; Non Conformance type is Other.    Non Conformance 2007-011_7 is found during Audit 2007-011;

On file at site was only the latest edition of the Investigator Brochure (IB) with a cut-off date as per 01-Jun-2011 and the monthly SUSAR line listings from November 2011 and onwards. The investigators should have access to the relevant new information from the cut-off date of the current IB version to the start of the study at each site. If there is no relevant new information, there should be a note documenting this. Furthermore, the line listings from November 2011 to April 2012 were signed off in a batch on 25-Jun-2012 by the PI. Non Conformance 2007-011_7 reported date is 6/12/2012; Non Conformance closed date is 23/08/2012; Non Conformance rating is Minor; Non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.          Non Conformance 2007-011_8 is found during Audit 2007-011;
Lack of information on the ""Investigator Source Agreement"" (ICH-GCP 1.51, 1.52 and 6.4.9). The ""Investigator Source Agreement"" is an ICON standard document. When reviewing the form it was observed that several data items were missing, eg: all rating scales, patient reported outcome documents and the ECG measurement. This is not an all-inclusive list of missing data items, the form should be updated according to the requirements in the protocol. Furthermore, the form is not specific enough regarding what document a specific data item is recorded on and where the document is located.

As per local regulation the sponsor must submit a list of all suspected study-emergent
serious adverse reactions to the Competent authority and relevant Ethics Committee
once a year throughout the clinical trial. The submission must include a Finnish version
of an evaluation on the study subjects' safety, which is to be provided by the person in
charge (country coordinating investigator) of the study.
a) There was no evidence that the annual safety information to the Ethics Committee
was submitted during the course of the study as required by the focal regulation. The
AA21004 Annual Safety Reports {ASRs) covering period 01-May-2008 - 30-Apr-2009
and 01-May-2009-30-Apr-2010 were submitted to the Competent Authority by LuFinland
(Lu-FIN) on 29-Jun-2009 and 29-Jun-2010 respectively. The Appendix 1 of the
Adverse Event Management Plan study 12541A that describes the safety reporting
responsibilities in Finland stated that ASR was to be submitted to the CA (by Lu-FIN PV
contact person), however, the plan lacked to describe the submission responsibility of
the ASR to the EC.

Inadequate process for providing within the agreed timelines the off-site archived  I-TMF to the investigator – non-compliance with ICH GCP 5.5.6.  a) According to the instructions provided in the off-site archived booklet and on the RECALL Retrieval Form; RECALL should ship the I-TMF to an investigator within 24 hours of receiving the faxed Retrieval Form. A fax confirmation demonstrated that the Retrieval Form for the I-TMF had been successfully faxed to RECALL on the 25-Jun-2012 at 09:33 AM.  It was later confirmed by RECALL that the I-TMF had not been shipped until the afternoon of the 27-Jun-2012. In addition, RECALL did not inform the investigator of the receipt of the fax or of the date as to when the I-TMF would be shipped to him.  b) There was insufficient contact information provided to the investigator; the only contact information provided by RECALL was a fax number and the general phone number for Lundbeck with instructions to request for the RCA department. The investigator informed the audit team that he did attempt to call Lundbeck at the number provided on the retrieval form, but was unable to get in touch with the RCA department.  Corrections, corrective & preventive actions required.

Non Conformance 2007-030_4 is found during Audit 2007-030;
Inadequate completion of the IMP Shipment and Return Forms – non-compliance with ICH GCP 5.14.4.
 The IMP shipments and return forms were not completed adequately providing full traceability and accountability of the IMPs, for example: a) The first shipment of IMP dated 18-Aug-2006 included shipment of 8 patients kits (R1017 through R1024);  i) For the information pertaining to the treatment period, number of tablets, expiry date and packaging number, was recorded for only one row (one IMP randomisation kit) as opposed to have it completed for each individual rows where the randomisation kits were listed. It was then unclear if the number of tablets “158” applied to each of the randomisation kits or to the whole shipment. ii)The treatment period covered by the IMP kits was not indicated, the number “o” was recorded under that column  b ) Inadequacies similar to what was described above were observed on the IMP shipments forms for each of the six shipments made to the site.  No corrections or corrective actions; Preventive actions required.
For the non conformance 2007-030_4, the reported date is 11/07/2012;
the closed date is 26/11/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.
									 Non Conformance 2007-030_5 is found during Audit 2007-030;
										 	Incomplete filing of the IMP Shipment and Return Forms in the sponsor TMF -Non compliance with ICH GCP 8.4.1.  According to the sponsor TMF index, IMP shipments and returns forms should be filed in section 2.1 at the site level. There were not any IMP shipments and return forms filed in the sponsor TMF either at the site or country level. Copies of the IMP shipments and returns forms provided to the audit team by the Clinical Supplies department had been obtained. These IMP shipments and returns forms were filed in the sponsor CMC file,  however, some of the IMP shipments and return forms were missing, ie:  i) For shipment made on 18-Aug-2006; the IMP shipment form for the IMP sent from CTS HLu to Tamro OY was not on file ii) For shipment sent on 09-Oct-2006, the IMP shipment form for the IMP sent from Tamro Oy to Dr. Ahokas was not on file iii) For shipment sent 18-Dec-2006, the IMP shipment form for the IMP sent from CTS HLu to Tamro Oy was missing  iv) For the shipment made on 09-Jan-2007, the IMP shipment form from Tamro OY to Dr. Ahokas was missing v)  For the shipment made on 05-Feb-2007 (R1897-1900), the IMP shipment form indicated that the shipment was sent to the site directly from CTS HLU; however, in the investigator TMF, a shipment form indicated that a shipment with the same IMP (R1897 to R1900) was sent from Tamro OY to the site.   vi) For the shipment made on 02-Mar-2007, the IMP shipment form from Tamro OY to Dr. Ahokas was missing  vii) For all the corresponding IMP shipments, the IMP return forms (from the CMC file) for the returns from the site to Tamro OY were missing. Corrections, corrective & preventive actions required  GCQA to review CAPAs.

Non Conformance 2007-030_6 is found during Audit 2007-030;
Inadequate packaging of the investigator TMF for the long-term archiving - noncompliance with ICH GCP 8.4.
 a) Original medical records were filed within the study binders of the investigator TMF; original medical notes and pre-screened questionnaires were filed in the investigator TMF as opposed being filed with the patient's medical records. The investigator did not remember the rationale for having the records filed within the I-TMF. At the request of the investigator, the original medical records were removed from the I-TMF and filed with the patients medical records. b) Documents from both the 11492A and 11492C were filed within the same TMF. Each patient study binder included the patient binder for the 11492C study followed by the patient binder of the 11492A study. In addition snap binders were packed with the binders from two patients; this made it difficult to consult. The audit team repacked the study binders for each patient separately keeping a chronologie order (the documents for the 11492A study in front of the documents 11492C study). No corrections or corrective actions; Preventive actions required.
For the non conformance 2007-030_6, the reported date is 11/07/2012;

Audit 2008-001

Audit Number is 2008-001.
Scope:
Audit 2008-001 is a System audit falling under Vendor category. 
Previously, a secure pdf copy of data entered from sites through the eDE system was hosted by DFG, VA, USA (Site Audit no 2005-GCP-011). Acme Corporation has chosen to use BGT’ Data Center in Kansas City for the third party hosting instead.  The BGT Data Center in Kansas, USA where hosting of data collected through eRT’s eDE will take place. Review of the facilities and server room and relevant procedures is included.
Approach:
The audit was conducted according to Acme Corporation SOP Process and System Audits SOP_04025, edition 2.0, and the audit agenda dated 14-Dec-2007, and included the following activities:  • Opening meeting • Interviews with key personnel • Review documentation  • Review of facilities and the Data Center • Closing meeting																						
Non Conformances:

Non Conformance 2008-001_1 is found during Audit 2008-001;
Discrepancies between source documentation and eCRF were observed - noncompliances
with ICH GCP 4. 9.1.

Medical records indicated that patient 51041 was taking concomitant medication
Trendal 400mg for asthma prior and during the conduct of the study, however, the
concomitant medication was not captured in the eCRF.
No corrections or corrective actions required
Preventive actions required.
For the non conformance 2008-001_1, the reported date is 9/07/2012;
the closed date is 26/11/2012;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Other.

Non Conformance 2008-001_2 is found during Audit 2008-001;
Inadequate documentation for the reporting of adverse events. Non-compliance with
ICH GCP 4.11.2.
a) Subject 51589 I R8904: The adverse event (dizziness) recorded in visit 3 (06-0ct-
2009) medical notes was not captured in the eCRF.
b) Although data entry was performed timely and only by the PI, the adverse events
recorded in the medical notes lacked details for the assessments of their causality and
intensity.
According to the Source Data Identification Form signed by the investigator on 11-May-
2009, the medical records were to be considered the source data for the reporting of
AEs, however, the study binder included a study specific AE Form; the form was only
partially completed by the investigator, ie:
i) For patient 51557; the medical records indicated two AEs (nausea and dizziness),
however, on the Lundbeck AE form only nausea was reported
ii) For patient 51585; the medical records indicated one AE constipation with a start
date of 30-0ct-2009 was reported at V6, however, the Lundbeck AE form was left
blank, etc.
c) There were several discrepancies for the SAE/AE reporting of patient 51050 (SAE
DKLU1037654- cholangiocarcinoma):
i) Out of ranges laboratory values considered clinically significant by the investigator
should be reported as an adverse event, the elevated GGT, ALT, AST (which lead to the
diagnosis of the SAE) were considered clinically significant by the investigator and had
been reported on the eCRF AE form; it was unclear why the events were later marked
deleted on the AE form although captured on the eCRF SAE Form. According to the
investigator, these values were deleted following receipt of a query; it was not possible
to see from the audit trail of the eCRF CD-ROM that a query had been issued to the
investigator.
ii) The Lundbeck AE Form filed in the study binder listed the elevated values as AEs,
however the form was partially completed by the investigator and was left unsigned by the investigator.

Inadequate process for providing within the agreed timelines the off-site archived ITMF
to the investigator - non-compliance with ICH GCP 5.5.6.

a) According to the instructions provided in the off-site archived booklet and on the
RECALL Retrieval Form; RECALL should ship the I-TMF to an investigator within 24
hours of receiving the faxed Retrieval Form. A fax confirmation demonstrated that the
Retrieval Form for the I-TMF had been successfully faxed to RECALL on the 25-Jun-
2012 at 09:33AM. It was later confirmed by RECALL that the I-TMF had not been
shipped until the afternoon of the 27-Jun-2012. In addition, RECALL did not informed
the investigator of the receipt of the fax or of the date as to when the I-TMF would be
shipped to him.
b) There was insufficient contact information provided to the investigator; the only
contact information provided by RECALL was a fax number and the general phone
number for Lundbeck with instructions to request for the RCA department. The
investigator informed the audit team that he did attempted to call Lundbeck at the
number provided on the retrieval form, but was unable to get in touch with the RCA
department.

Non Conformance 2008-001_4 is found during Audit 2008-001;
Incomplete audit trail and unclear versioning of the eCRF- non-compliance with ICH
GCP 5.5.3c).
The date and version number indicated in the footer of the pdf of the eCRF pages kept
in the I-TMF did not match with the date when the data was entered in the eCRF, ie:
Patient 1006 signed the informed consent on 29-Jan-2009 and t he data entry for the
screening visit was done on the same day, however, the pdf of the CRF pages was
identified in the footer of the pages as follows in the footer: ""07.0163 21-Apr-2009
(5105""). It was therefore unclear what the date in the footer meant, and how could this
date be later than the data entry date.
Six versions of the eCRF Specification Migrations for eCRF version 5105 were available
in PLUTO; however, according to the history provided on these documents it was the
unapproved version 0.1 entitled ""original draft"" that corresponded to the date 21-Apr-
2009. It is not possible to see from the documentation available the corresponding
date to the approved eCRF and the corresponding migration dates for the
implementation of the updated eCRFs.
Corrections, corrective & preventive actions required.

Services Agreements with the Call Center (CRO) "Trial Support Form"and the
Cardiology Services were not located in the sponsor and investigator TMF- Non -
compliance with ICH GCP 8.4.
a) Although the responsible person at the Call Center was listed on the signature
and delegation log, the investigator indicated that the Call Center person was
part of the CRO Trial Support Form. There was no agreement available in either
the sponsor or investigator TMF documenting the contractual arrangements made
with the CRO. According to the investigator, this Call Center was used for all the
sites in Finland; he was not aware if contractual arrangements had been made or
not with the CRO, but for previous and subsequent studies conducted in Finland,
a service agreement had been located in the sponsor TMF.
b) The Service Agreement made with the Cardiology Services was not located in
either sponsor or investigator TMF; the cardiologists providing the services were
listed on the signature and delegation list.

Audit 2008-002

Audit Number is 2008-002.
Scope:
Audit 2008-002 is a System audit falling under Vendor category. The GHJ Data Center in Houston, USA where hosting of data collected through GHJ’s Rave system will take place. Review of the facilities and server room and relevant procedures is included.  Some issues regarding GHJ’s handling of Corrective and Preventive Actions had occurred late 2007 and in the beginning of 2008. The CAPA procedures were also included in the audit.
Approach:
	The audit was conducted according to Acme Corporation Process and System Audits SOP_04025, edition 2.0, and the audit agenda dated 14-Dec-2007, and included the following activities:  • Opening meeting • Interviews with key personnel • Review documentation incl. potential validation documents • Review of the facilities   • Closing meeting																						
Non Conformances:

Non Conformance 2008-002_1 is found during Audit 2008-002;
Lack or properly randomising a subject and informing the Ethics Committee thereof
(ICH-GCP 4.7).
Subject 51704 was dispensed a wrong IMP kit at visit 2 occurring 21 -Jun-2011: the
subject received the kit numbered A16628 instead of 16862; which was only noted by
the PI one month later, on 27-Jul-2011 in the subject medical records. Although the
protocol deviation was reported in the protocol deviation log; the deviation was not
reported to the ECs

CAPA required.
For the non conformance 2008-002_1, the reported date is 3/07/2012;
the closed date is 27/02/2013;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance 2008-002_2 is found during Audit 2008-002;


Inappropriate request prior taking a subject informed consent (ICH-GCP 4.8.8).

For all the subjects reviewed, the study information was given few days prior to the
screening visit and the subject was sent home with the SIS to take ample time for
considering participation as required.
However all subjects were advised that if they would agree to participate to the study,
it was better if they would come back fasting. As per the PI this was only a suggestion,
not a request. It was noticed that some of the subjects went back fast ing for the
screening visit and some did not.
It was explained that for insurance and liability reasons, requesting or suggesting a
subject to fast in the perspective of the study is considered a study procedure and
therefore, not considered appropriate before a consent is signed.
No corrections required.

For the non conformance 2008-002_2, the reported date is 3/07/2012;

Non Conformance 2008-002_3 is found during Audit 2008-002;

Discrepancies between the source documents and the eCRF (ICH-GCP 4.9.2).

a) According to the protocol section 7.2, concomitant medication taken within 3
months of screening visit were to be captured in the eCRF. There were lacks in
reporting these into the eCRF for at least two patients, ie:
i) patient 51711 was screened on 16-Jun-2011 and received last dose of
immovane (prescribed for insomnia) on 15-May-2011
ii) patient 51247 was screened on 28-Dec-2011 and received last dose of
zopiclone (prescribed for insomnia) on 01-0ct-2010
b) For patient 51515; AE nausea was reported at visit 3 (26-Apr-2011); there was
no stop date mentioned in the source, although in the eCRF there was a stop date
of 01-Jun-2011.

Incomplete medical notes with regards to laboratory tests not performed (ICH-GCP
4.9.1).
For patient 51113, the laboratory results indicated that the haematology tests were
deleted (ie:, they were shipped but could not be analysed); however, there was no
explanation either on the lab results or in the medical progress notes indicating the
lacking test and the actions taken.
No corrections required.
For the non conformance 2008-002_4, the reported date is 3/07/2012;
the closed date is 27/02/2013;
the rating is Minor;
And the non Conformance type is Data breach.

Non Conformance 2008-002_5 is found during Audit 2008-002;

ECG printouts not on A4 format paper; therefore not allowing good quality copies to be
made (ICH-GCP 4.9.4).
The ECG print outs were on American standard size paper (81/2 Xll i'lches),
consequently it had not been not possible to make same size copies; all copies made
had either the header or footer cut-off, as the EU size paper is narrower. When the
header was cut off, the date and time of the ECG as well as the patient ID number were
lacking; when the footer was cut off, the voltage and speed of the ECG equipment were
lacking.
Since all the ECG machines were provided by Lundbeck, this may concern all sites using
the same kind of machine and therefore should be taken-up at the process level.
CAPA required.

Non Conformance 2008-002_7 is found during Audit 2008-002;

Unclear process for the submission of CIOMS to the site (ICH-GCP 4.11.1).

According to the Operational Manual, Quintiles was responsible to submit the SUSAR
line listing to the ECs, it is unclear why letters with CIOMS attached we re sent to the
investigator requesting him to submit the CIOMS to his EC. In addition the following
discrepancies were found :
1. Letter was not sent to the investigator for every SUSARS reported in the
line listing, ie: CIOMS DKLU1067675; a letter was sent for the initial
CIOMS as well as follow-up CIOMS 1,4,5,6, however, there were no CIOMS
2 and 3 available;
2. Some letters made a reference to study 11984A as opposed to 13267A;
3. Some letters made a reference to an SAE (eg:, DKLU1070543) as
opposed to a SUSAR;
4. Several letters were filed in duplicate.

Non Conformance 2008-002_8 is found during Audit 2008-002;
Unclear handling of a wrongly randomised subject (ICH-GCP 5.5.1).

As described in observation # 1, Subject 51704 was dispensed a wrong IMP kit at visit
2 (randomisation) occurring 21-Jun-2011: the subject received the kit numbered
A16628 instead of 16862; which was only noted by the PI one month later, on 27-Jul-
2011.
It was further noticed that this patient was not excluded from the per protocol set, and
this deviation to the randomisation schedule was not documented in t1e blinded data
review meeting minutes.
CAPA required.

Non Conformance 2008-002_9 is found during Audit 2008-002;
Incomplete audit trail and unclear versioning of the eCRF - non-compliance with ICH
GCP 5.5.3c).
The date and version number indicated in the footer of the pdf of the · ~CRF pages kept
in the I-TMF did not match with the date when the data was entered i 1 the eCRF, ie:
Patient 1159 signed the informed consent on 25-0ct-2010 and the da·:a entry for the
screening visit was done either the same day or within a few days of the patient's visit,
however, the pdf of the CRF pages was identified in the footer of the pages as follows in
the footer:"" 03.0264 07-Jan-2011 RS Post Amendment (6008""). It was therefore
unclear what the date in the footer meant, and how could this date be later than the
data entry date.
In addition, it was not possible to locate in PLUTO, the history of the versions of the
eCRF or to have a listing indicating as to when these versions were migrated at the
country and site level. Hence, it was not possible either to verify if the investigator had
the correct blank copies of the eCRFs updates.
CAPA required.

however, the Files Notes are not included in the sponsor TMF an ::I it is unclear if
they have been included in all the sites I-TMFs
i. The first File Note pertaining to Urinalysis Microscopic indicated that the
""trigger for completion of Urine Microscopy based on an abnormal Ketone
result was programmed incorrectly"". For the patients where Urine Ketone
results were abnormal, urine microscopic was not performed as indicated in
the protocol. Attached to the File Note, a list of sites and patients including the
visit # is included. Dr. Magi had two patients (51113 and 51 ~ ) 85) for which
trace of ketone did not trigger an urine microscopic test.
ii. The second File Note is to advise of a calculation error with t he exclusion
criteria for Total Bilirubin and the exclusion criteria for Creati 1ine for male
patients. For total bilirubin, the exclusion value was calculated at 31umoi/L as
opposed to 32unmoi/L and for Creatinine, the value was calcJiated at
172unmoi/L as opposed to 171unmoi/L. A list of the laboratory standards
values is attached; Quintiles confirmed that none of the pati€ nts included in
the trial were affected by the deviation.

a) Incorrect Financial Disclosure forms signed by the investigators
The form FDA 3455 was signed by the investigators; this form should be signed off
by the applicant (study sponsor); in addition the form does not state the names of
the company for which interest should be declared (ie: Lundbeck <md Takeda)
b) The temperature log covering the period from 24-Dec-2010 to 26-Jan-2011 was
lacking from the I-TMF. The single sheet covering this period could neither be
located in the sponsor TMF during the audit.
c) One of the IMP tear-off labels was lacking from the dedicated label sheet; this
concerned one of the four IMP boxes which had been lost.

Audit 2008-005

Audit Number is 2008-005.
Scope:
Audit 2008-005 is a System audit falling under Vendor category. 
The audit covered VBN’s organisation and Quality Management System, product specifics, SDLC and support and maintenance. Furthermore validation of the software was reviewed and assessed according to Acme Corporation standards and eg: 21 CFR Part 11.  The Objectives of the audit were to: • Review the Quality Management System (QMS) and assess the level of its implementation • Review the SDLC  • Review validation documentation of the system (including release documentation). • Evaluate customer support procedures (eg: system for following up on customer queries/issues) • Evaluate maintenance procedures • Assess to which degree the validation package complies with Acme Corporation requirement as well as regulatory requirements (eg: 21 CFR Part 11, ICH GCP) • If areas do not comply with Acme Corporation’s requirements to evaluate whether a workaround solution is possible  It was not in scope of the audit to make a technical assessment of the suitability of the software: CDR/SCE for the intended use. Also it is not in scope of the audit to make any investigation of the vendor’s financial status.
Approach:
	The audit was conducted according to Acme Corporation SOP _04025: Process and System Audit; version 2, and the audit agenda dated 08-Jan-2008, and included the following activities: • Opening meeting • Presentations by VBN according to the agenda • Review of documentation incl. validation documents • Review of facilities  • Closing meeting.																					
Non Conformances:

Non Conformance 2008-005_6 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Lack of compliance with the approved protocol (ICH-GCP 4.5.2).

A) According to the SI (XKP), she did all her ratings of the patient and subsequently the patient,
did the Patient-Reported Outcome scales. This is not in accordance with the protocol section 7.4,
according to which the patient reported health economy assessments (PDQ-3? and EQ-50))
should be completed before the clinician-rated assessments.
B) Patients are requested to completed a diary prior to visit 3, although not required by the
protocol
C) Prior to the on-site audit, GCQA had been alerted by the Clinical Team, that there were issues
with the patient diaries, at the site. For some of the data, they were identical at some
subsequent days. This was the case for subjectS 1049, for whom all data including the patient
diary was reviewed during the audit.
For S 1049 the following data were identical:
• Visit 2, day 2 (19-Mar-20 12) and day 3 (20-Mar-2012)
• Visit 4, day 1 (15-Apr-2012), day 2 (16-Apr-2012) and day 3 (17-Apr-2012)
The diary completion process was discussed in details with the SI (XKP) after review of the
completed source diaries. From review of the diaries, it looks like two different persons, may
have completed them and they are also signed by both the patient and the care-giver. From the
review it cannot be excluded, that the caregiver completed part of the diary for the patient.
The SI denied that she had completed any patient diary, and also stated that she had instructed
the patient and the caregiver to be more careful, when completing the dia1 ies.
The 13445 Patient Reported-outcomes Guideline, H. Lundbeck, 27-July-2011 (which was
obtained in the English version after the on-site audit) writes that the caregiver's signature
must be compl eted~ however it is not described that the caregiver can complete the diary.
For the non conformance 2008-005_6, the reported date is 7/09/2012;
the closed date is 23/11/2012;
the rating is Major;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance 2008-005_7 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Failure by the investigator to Provide/documentation that subjects were given ample time to decide on whether or not to ParticiPate in the trial (ICH-GCP 4.8.7).

All of the included patients were consented during the screening visit. It was not clear how they were
provided with ample time to consider their participation.
The Pre-Trial Visit Report section 20, identifies ample time as at least one day.
A) According to the Investigators most patients had their caregiver with them for the visits to the
clinic, however this was not documented in the medical records, and it was not documented
how ample time was ensured during the screening visit. The Investigators were recommended
for future studies to consider changing the informed consent process to ensure that the
patients' are given ample time to consider study participation.
B) Further it was not clear from the medical notes, that patient had been informed that they can
withdraw from the study at any time.
For the non conformance 2008-005_7, the reported date is 7/09/2012;

Non Conformance 2008-005_8 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Failure by the Investigator to maintain adequate records and reports and to give access to the CRA to the electronic in-patient records (ICH-GCP 4.9).

In general the quality of the medical records was good and included clinical progtess notes. However
for concomitant medication the medical records were not always specific on start and stop dates. In
relation to eligibil ity they did not include absence of relevant psychiatric diseases The following
issues were noted with the medical notes:
A) The CRA did not have access to the electronic inpatient medical records, which she should
have as 30% of the patients, which is about 6 patients, had been in-patient -; according to the SI
(XKP). The Auditor had access to the hospitalisation records for one patient (S 1 002). This
patient had one hospitalisation about one month prior to enrolment and a second during
admission due to anSAE during the trial. For this patient the CRA only got access to a copy
of the discharge summary
B) For S 1002 it was found out during the audit, that the patient had participated in a Sifrol study,
however this is not mentioned in the medical records. According to SI there are study specific
records on file in the Department, as they are archived with the Institution, at study
conclusion. In addition medical records are not kept at the hospital for any out-patient visit, as
these records in China belongs to the patient. It was suggest considering creating a system, for
these patients if they participates in the trial/trials, keeping copies of the medical records for
routine outpatient visits and creating a list for their participation in clinical trials and to
include information about previous participation in clinical studies.
The electronic medical records system used by the hospital for all in-patie'1ts did not requi re
any change in password (only to reset the first password assigned by IT) (non-compliance
with FDA 21 CFR Part 11).
For the non conformance 2008-005_8, the reported date is 7/09/2012;
the closed date is 23/11/2012;
the rating is Major;
And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance 2008-005_9 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Failure b;t the investigator to ensure timeliness of the data reported to sponsor in the eCRF (ICH-GCP 4.9.1).
During the audit preparations (starting 19-Jul-20 12) it was noticed that the folio\\ ing visits were not
yet entered in the eCRF/Rave. According to the protocol it is recommended to have data reported into
the eCRF/Rave within 2-3 days.
Some examples of late data entry:
• S1069: Visit V5 (04-Jun-2012) was data entered 20-Jul-2012 and visit 6 ( 2-Jul-2012) was
entered 20-Jul-2012
• S1071: Visit 5 (06-Jun-20 12) was data entered 11-Jun-2012 and visit 6 (O·l-Jul-2012) was data
entered 19-Jul-20 12
• Sl091 : Visit 5 (29-Jun-2012) was data entered 20-Jul-2012
• S 1112: Visit 4 (25-Jun-2012) was data entered 20-Jul-2012.
For the non conformance 2008-005_9, the reported date is 7/09/2012;

And the non Conformance type is Deviation from Process and procedures.

Non Conformance 2008-005_10 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Multiple inconsistencies between the data in the eCRF/Rave and the source documents (ICH-GCP 4.9.2);
Multiple inconsistencies were observed between the Rave data and the source documents, most
notably related to lack of reporting of adverse events and concomitant medication, and inconsistency
in the concomitant medication in the Rave compared to the data in the source.
Due to this and due to the lack of access to the electronic in-patients ' records, it i 'i recommended to
consider re-monitoring of the study at the site.
The following observations were made:
81002 (screened on 21-Dec-2011)
i) Madopar, and Sinemet was started 21-0ct-20 11 according to Rave -the rr edical record stated
Nov-2011.
ii) Diamicron 50 mg in Rave was, it should be 30 mg
iii) 02-Apr-2012 aspirin 1 OOmg was prescribed according to medical record, this was not included
in Rave. According to SI (XKP) the patient did not want to take it- a note about this is
missing in medical record. Aspirin was prescribed following a MRI/MRA scan showing
vascular thinning.
iv) Piribedil treatment started UU2011 according to Rave, but this date could not be verified in
the medical record.
v) During hospitalisation for the SAE (date of di scharge 02-Apr-2012) the patient was diagnosed
with REM sleep disorder, this was not entered in Rave as AE.
81049 (screened on 22-Feb-2012)
i) According to the medical record the patient had a previous CT scan showing brain atrophy
and a previous head injury. The medical records did not include any comments regarding
lack of influence (if this was the case) of these CT scan findings on the current diagnose of
idiopathic Parkinson disease. Brain atrophy and head injury was not ircluded in the
medical history in Rave.
ii) Back pain and depression was included in the medical records (copy of pr ~vious records,
present as loose notes) from a visit 03-Feb-20 12 (prior to inclusion int ;) the study). Back pain and depression was not entered into the medical history of the Rave system, and there
was no note in the medical records, as to whether these conditions perHisted during the
13445A study partipation
iii) Sinus tachycardia and cervical spondylosis in the medical record was not entered in the Rave
system as medical history.
iv) The fo llowing concomitant medication was present in the medical records, but not entered in
Rave: Artan (trihexyphenidyl) Y2 tablet 3 times daily, stopped on 03-Feb-2012. Ibuprofen
(no dose stated), was taken for the least two days in May-2012. Amox cillin and herbal
medicine had according to medical record taken since May-20 12.
v) The following AEs were reported in the medical records but not in Rave: 1ncreasing pain
(aggressive) headache, left frontal and temporal pain and tense/pain al over the body.
Furthermore consider reporting weight loss and decreased appetite. At visit 6 the medical
record included dizziness (still some was present)
Sl082 (screened on 06-Spr-2012)
Two AEs were present in the medical record, but not reported in the Rave system
i) Breath shortness, which the patient had had for years but which was now ·ncreased. Consider
to include it also in the medical history in Rave
ii) Increased sweating
SllSl (screened on 27-Jun-2012)
I. The medical record included as medical history information: constipation, urine cysts and
cholelithiasis; none of these were included in Rave.
2. The medical record included one AE: Patient fell and hurt the foot, which was not entered into
the Rave system.

Non Conformance 2008-005_12 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Lack of ensuring quality assurance and quality control to ensure protocol compliance (ICH-GCP 5.1.1).

This was evidenced by:
For the patients reviewed, the Investigator had for all visits, reported the outcome of the physical and
neurological examinations as normal, even though some were abnormal due to tl e Parkinson
disease's physical and neurological changes. Examples are: tremor, rigidity, muscular tension
increased, limbs moving slowly, mask face etc.
The Investigator had reported the full outcome of these examinations in the source, but had been
requested to enter normal in the Rave.
Covance informed the Auditor, that according to Lundbeck's instruction the physical and
neurological examinations have to be completed as normal, even if they are abnormal due to the
Parkinson disease.
This instruction is not in accordance with the protocol
For the non conformance 2008-005_12, the reported date is 7/09/2012;

Non Conformance 2008-005_13 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Failure to ensure validity for electronic trial data handling and/or remote electronic data systems
(ICH-GCP 5.5.1A) .
The Rave system indicates that if a laboratory result is clinically significant at the screening
visit, the patient must not be included. This is not in conformity with the ;>rotocol exclusion
criteria #3, which states could (include laboratory tests at screening).
For subject S 1002 at screening the Investigator (XKP) entered into the Rave system, that the
blood glucose value was clinical significant (this patient had an already k11ow type II
diabetes). The Rave system fired an automatic request to make the patien a screen failure.
Subsequently the Investigator changed the blood glucose value to not clirical significant- as
she found the patient eligible and after discussion with Covance (according to Covance). The
Investigator made a note in the source, to document that she still conside1 the blood glucose
value clinical significant and that the patient could be included in spite of this
B) The Rave system also includes for ECG results, that if the ECG is abnomtal and clinically
significant at the screening visit, the patient must not be included. This is not in conformity
with the protocol.

Delay in making the updated Investigator Brochure available to the site (ICH-GCP 5.12.2).
Investigator Brochure version 20, issued in English 20-Aug-2011, was first submitted to EC on 09-May-2012. The Chinese version was issued 23-Apr-2012- so apparently it took about 8 month to create the translation.

Failure to inform the involved parties (monitors, investigators, pharmacists and storage managers) of acceptable storage temperature and conditions (ICH-GCP 5.13.2).

IMP Order 10056, temperature logger active during shipment, showed highest temperature 29,7
without any alarm
Order 10062 temperature logger showed highest temperature as 32.8 during transport without
alarm
Order 10068 temperature logger showed highest temperature as 33.4, without any alarm
Order 10075 temperature logger show highest temperature as 29.4, without any alarm
Order 10056 temperature logger, showed highest temperature as 29,7 without any alarm
At the site, there is no explanation for why these high temperatures are permitted or what would
be acceptable/not acceptable for the site and a monitor/auditor/inspector to verify .

Non Conformance 2008-005_16 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Inadequate monitoring CICH-GCP 5.18.1-5. 18.6).
The quality of the monitoring in particular the source data verification was found to be inadequate,
please refer to observations # 8 (lack of access to all records) and # 10 (inconsistent data and lack of
reporting by the site of concomitant medication and reporting of AEs).
A) The monitor did not seek access to the full medical records for patients that had previously
been hospitali sed in the department. For subjectS 1002 a copy of a discharge summary had
been used for the monitoring.
B) Further the CRA was not aware, that the hospital had an electronic record system for the
hospitalised patients, and had therefore not asked for access to see these records, when
relevant.
C) According to the monitoring visit reports, there had been a delay in SDV at this high
recruiting site. The CRA several times stated that she did not have enough time to do the
SDV: Trip report#5 from visit on 12-Apr-2012, Trip Report #6 fTom visit on 24-May-2012
and Trip Report#7 on 15-J un-20 12. It was not clear what had been done to overcome this lack
of adequate monitoring resources at the site or how this had been resolved
The following delays were observed (examples):
i) Sll45 only screening visit and PDQ-5 from the baseline visit (visit date: 11-Jul-2012)
was monitored.
ii) S11 12 not monitored. For the screening visit of 17-May-2012 data was not entered
until 20-Jul-201 2, and the baseline visit of25-May was data entered on 11 and 23 of
Jun-2012
iii) SIIOO the screening of04-May-2012 and baseline visit of 17-May-2012 were
monitored, but none of the following visits
iv) S1091 up to and including visit 4 31-May-2012 was monitored. Visit 5 which took
place 29-Jun-2012 was not yet monitored
v) S 1145 the screening visit of20-Jun-2012 was monitored but for the baseline visit 11-Jul-2012 only PDQ-39 and HEA was monitored

vi)
vii)
S 1150 was not monitored at all, the screening visit was 18-Jul-20 12
S I 165 the screening visit 16-Jul-20 12 was monitored, but none of the following visits
D) The CRA answered a clinical question to the Investigator within the Rave system: For subject
S 1002 at screening the Investigator (XKP) entered into the Rave system, trat the blood
glucose value was clinical significant (this patient had an already know type II diabetes). The
Rave system fired an automatic query.
Further the CRA, answered the query to the Investigator in Rave, which was 'The laboratory
result is reported as clinically significant. If at Screening make sure the patient is a screening
failure. After Screening, check that the corresponding AE has been created.' The CRA
answered: 'Due to the patient has DM II medical history, the glucose high value is clinically
significant, but it's not related to exclusion criteria.' (CRA from System). Any medical
questions should be answered by the site and not the CRA.
E) The source worksheets provided by Covance were found to be deficient on the following
ISSUe:
i) There was no separate neurological examination worksheet, but one single ti ck box, at the end
of the physical examination worksheet. If the Investigator only documented the
neurological examination on the worksheet, there would be a lack of details for the
neurological examination
ii) The worksheet for the dermatological examination, only contained one sin ~le row of tick
boxes, and it was unclear what the dermatologist was ticking off for- if it was for the
examination done; and then it was not possible to include any description if something
was found or there was an absence of finding. The form did include a statement that any
findings had to be reported in the medical records by the dermatologist.
F) DKLU1077892 CIOMS (version date received by manufacturer 23-May-2012) states that no
treatment was received however the patient received metformin 0.25mg 3 times daily since
24-Mar-2012 and diamicron 50 mg daily since 25-Mar-2012, both prescribed for type II
diabetes. These data was entered in the Rave on 11-Jun-20 11 .
Within the CIOMS it is stated: Smoking ??? - according to the Rave and source the patient
smokes.

Non Conformance 2008-005_17 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Lack of availability of documents for audits and inspections and for successful management of the trial by the sponsor (ICH-GCP 8.1).
A) Already from starting in-house preparations for the audits in Jun-2012, th<• auditor noticed that
multiple documents were missing from the eTMFs. On requests some do<•uments has been
uploaded, however still multiple documents are missing.
B) This observation also have implication for the management of the study b f Lund beck, as the
clinical team did not have access to documents in the eTMF, which are irrportant to maintain
an overview of the study management by the CRO.
Examples of missing documents:
• Copies of EC approvals (CN original versions) were missing
• Trip reports from site initiation visit report, monitoring visits 11-Jun-20 12 and 19-25-Jul-
2012, and all follow up letters were missing from the eTMF prior to the audit.
• The documentation of the investigators qualifications, medical license, and GCP training
documentation was incomplete

Non Conformance 2008-005_18 is found during Audit 2008-005;
Lack of essential documentation to confirm the validity of the trial CICH-GCP 8.2.12.
A) In general there was a lack of records for calibration of the equipment used forth' trial, or it had not
been calibrated:
i) The hospita l's technical department was responsible for calibration ofth hospital equipment
and calibrated equipment was labelled by the department, with the date ' ' hen recalibration was
required. However validation records were not filed in the Investigator T v1 F for the following
equipment: ECG recording equipment(Fukuda Denshi), the sphygmomanometer for
measurement of blood pressure and centrifuges used
ii) Further the scale and the site's min/max thermometer for monitoring oft~ e IMP storage
temperature were not calibrated
iii) The centrifuge which had been supplied by Lundbeck, had been out of order (was removed
during the audit for re-calibration after the repair); however there was no documentation
available for the substitute centrifuge, which had been used for quite a w'1 ile.
B) The CY template provided by Covance for the staff to complete, did not require/ illlows to document
relevant cl inical experience and GCP training, including the date of the training
C) A copy of the Site Initiation Visit report was not fi led in the Investigator TMF (I¢ H-GCP 8.2.20)
A temperature excursion was found for IMP storage 18-Apr-20 12, this had been reported to Lundbeck, and the
report was present, however the response to the deviation and the conclusion with regard to use of the. IMP was
not filed in the Investigator TMF.

Non-compliance by IRB/EC with the principles of ICH-GCP, with regard to the following ( ICH GCP 3.1.1-3.1.9).
The Auditor could not have access to the procedures of EC (please refer to obs#2) and consequently,
was unable to verify the following ICH requirements:
A) The approval letter did not mention what the Investigator had to submit to EC while the study
was on-going ie:
B) Status of the trial conducted at intervals of at least annually (ICH-GCP 3.1.4)
C) EC did not specify* in their approval, that no deviations from, or changes to the protocol
should be initiated without the prior written EC approval/favourable opinion of an appropriate
amendment, except when necessary to eliminate an immediate hazard or when changes
involves only logistical or administrative aspects of the trial (ICH-GCP 3.3.7)
D) EC did not specify* in their approval, that the investigator should promptly report to the EC:
a) deviations from or changes to the protocol to eliminate immediate hazards to the trial
subjects b) changes increasing the risk to subjects and/or affecting significantly the conduct of
the trial c) all ADRs that are both serious and unexpected d) new information that may affect
adversely the safety of the subjects or the conduct of the trial (ICH-GCP 3.3.8)
Instead Covance had made a letter submitted by the PI to EC, stipulating that the following would be
submitted to EC by the PI: SAEs occurring at the site, within 24 hours; any SAEs from other sites in
China monthly; SUSARs and SADRs quarterly, and major protocol deviations. The letter was signed
by the PI and approved by the EC vice chairman. The frequency for submission of the SUSAR
listings was later updated to be submitted every 6 months.
Inadequacies of the EC approval document: It was unclear if the PI abstained from voting and was
still present or if he stepped out of the meeting. The PI confirmed that he first presented the protocol
and then stepped out of the meeting room, when the Committee voted for the protocol.

Non Conformance 2008-005_3 is found during Audit 2008-005;
The investigators did not provide full evidence of their qualifications in the CV and one investigator had not received update GCP training for more than 10 years (ICH-GCP 4.1.1).

A)
The CVs did not capture enough information about GCP training (dates/year) and in general there was a lack of details about previous clinical trial experience. In general the GCP training documentation was present separately.
Examples:
i)
PI: CV did not capture any clinical trial experience, also it did not clearly state that he is a neurologist
ii)
SI (XKP): CV did not capture any clinical trial experience.
iii)
SI (LJ): CV did not capture any clinical trial experience, but some clinical research experience. And it did not capture any information about GCP training. If she has not received any GCP training, she should receive it immediately.
B)
The PI had not received any updated GCP training since 2001.

Inadequate delegation /delegation records (ICH-GCP 4.1.5).

A)
The ECG Department recorded the ECGs, and if the recordings showed abnormalities, a cardiologist would evaluate the ECG. The cardiologist stamped and initialled the ECG traces for his review. According to the site, they had a written agreement with the ECG department; however this was not filed in the Investigator TMF. Furhter the CV was not collected from the head of the ECG department and filed in the Investigator TMF. The CV is required because the cardiologist evaluates the ECG tracings.
Inadequate delegation: The SCs were not delegated to enter data into the medical records.
